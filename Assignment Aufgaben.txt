Aufgabe 2)
 
a)The transformation rounds are a convinient protection against brute force attacks. Since the effectiveness
of brute force attacks depend on the time consumed per try, the "defender" can easily raise the transformation
rounds in order to increase the time. 

b)Yes, the ECB Mode is weakening the overall transformation. ECB Mode encrypts similar parts of the
plaintext equaly such that the ciphertext is going to be similar on the respective parts as well.
That means the attacker can retrieve valuable information about the key used. In the KeePass scenario
an attacker could use this weakness by using the XML Tags as similar palintext parts, the XML tags gonna 
be similar in every user database. An attacker could test encrypt many databases in the same way and find
out, which parts stay similar after the EBC Mode encryption.

c)Average time for 10000 digits = 3800 ms -> 2632 passwords per second.

For 10000 repetition rounds:
1. Extending key possiblities including 26 minor characters of the standard alphabet -> (26 + 10)^4 = 1679616
Time: 1679616/2632 = 638seconds

2. Extending key possiblities including 26 minor and 26 captial characters of the standard alphabet -> (26 + 26 + 10)^4 = 14776336
Time: 14776336/2632 = 5614seconds


For 1000000 repetition rounds:
Average time for 10000 four digit variations: 253968ms ~ 39 passwords per second
1. Extending key possiblities including 26 minor characters of the standard alphabet -> (26 + 10)^4 = 1679616
Time: 1679616/39 = 43067 seconds = 718 minutes ~ 12 hours

2. Extending key possiblities including 26 minor and 26 captial characters of the standard alphabet -> (26 + 26 + 10)^4 = 14776336
Time: 14776336/39 = 378880 seconds ~ 6315 minutes ~ 105 hours ~ 4,5 days
